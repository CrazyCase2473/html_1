    <h1>My Family</h1>
    <h3><em>Heather (My mom)</em></h3>
    <p>I met my mom when i was born back in 2008, in fact she was the one who birthed me. She is pretty chill.</p>
    <h3><em>Tracy (My dad)</em></h3>
    <p>I also met my dad back in 2008 when i was born, he was there for my birth and did witness it. I believe he also had something to do with my conception.</p>
    <h3><em>Tiegan (My sister)</em></h3>
    <p>I met my sister back in 2011, the day of her birth. I am like 80% sure that my parents are also her parents. She has been a sassy lil girl since she was born.</p>
    <h1>My Friends</h1>
    <h3><em>Matthew</em></h3>
    <p>I met Matthew our sophmore year where we became friends but we didnt really become great friends 
        until our second year at <abbr title="Francis Tuttle">FT</abbr>. Where we started go hang out with each other outside of school. 
        Matthew works at <a href ="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/menu.html">Panera</a>.
        (he is also mostly broke because he bought a miata)
    </p>
    <h3><em>Samuel</em></h3>
    <p>I met samuel back in '24 he was a pretty chill dude, but kinda weird cuz he's home schooled, but we were all weird back then so its alright. I am 78% sure his last name is Boudreau.</p>
    <h3><em>Braden</em></h3>
    <p>I met Braden back in the war of sophmore, I didnt really talk to him cuz he was in another class. But eventually we both ended up working at frontier city.</p>
