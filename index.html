    <h1>A few important people in my life</h1>
    <h2><em>Haily</em></h2>
    <p><strong>I met Haily at Frontier City in April 2025. She lives in midwest city and she goes to 
        <a href ="https://www.mid-del.net/o/CAHS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Carl Albert High School</em></a>. 
        I think that she is really pretty and I love talking to her.</strong><p>

    <h3><em>Matthew</em></h3>
    <p>I met Matthew our sophmore year where we became friends but we didnt really become great friends 
        until our second year at francis tuttle. Where we started go hang out with each other outside of school. 
        Matthew works at <a href ="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/menu.html">Panera</a>.
        (he is also really broke because he bought a miata)
